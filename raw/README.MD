The files in this directory contain the slightly modified data from their respective cities opendata website (see the readme of the root directory of this repo).

The file names were changed for clarity, because sometimes they were inconsistent over the years or the name of the city was omitted.

Encoding is UTF-8. The encoding of a few outlier files which were encoded differently was changed to UTF-8.
